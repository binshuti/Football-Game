# GAME OVERVIEW:
### This miniature soccer game is an interactive take the game of fooseball. You are given complete control over the soccer ball as you try to navigate it through the defenders in hopes of reaching the goal. At first the singular defender moving horizontally across the screen may seem like a breeze to get by, but every time you reach the goal another defender is placed on the field and the velocity of the ball is increased, making it even harder to control your movements.
